### About

This repository contains an analysis of baby name data in the US from 1910 to the present. At present, there isn't yet much (read: any) analysis done on the data beyond loading it into an easily usable form.

### Data

The data for this project comes from the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html) and is put together from the state-specific data zip archive. I also use a CSV file with state names and abbrevations from [jasonong on Github](https://github.com/jasonong/List-of-US-States).

### Notebooks

The notebooks in this repository are listed below with accompanying descriptions.
